True to his French roots, he can be aloof with strangers, but is affectionate and loving toward members of his pack. Bred as a herding and guard dog to protect flocks and fight off predators, he was adopted as a working dog during World War I and used by troops as sentries, ammunition carriers, messengers, and medic dogs. Today, the Briard enjoys the life of a companion dog, but he shows his versatility and working nature with his great successes in obedience, agility, conformation, herding, carting, and tracking competitions.",
